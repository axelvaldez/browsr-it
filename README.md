Browsr-it!

This app includes a simple web server node based. You can start it to avoid to use ***file://blah blah blah...***

You only need to have nodejs installed in your machine. After that, only navigate onto this project directory and write:

```
$ node server.js
```

If you see:

```
Listening @ port 3000...
```

Then, you're ready. Navigate in your favorite web browser to **[127.0.0.1:3000]** or **[localhost:3000]**. That's all.

Happy hacking!

[127.0.0.1:80]: http://127.0.0.1:3000/
[localhost:80]: http://localhost:3000/
